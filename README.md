## Imports:
The relevant libraries are imported, including react, useState, useEffect, and axios. Additionally, another component named SingleUserComp is imported.

## UserList Component:
A functional component named UserList is created. In React applications, components are defined as functions. This component is responsible for displaying a list of users.

## State and useState:
The useState hook is used to create a state variable called users, initialized as an empty array. The function setUsers is used to update the users state. This state will be used to store the user data fetched from the API.

## fetchUsers Function:
An asynchronous function named fetchUsers is created. This function uses the axios library to fetch data from the specified URL. It fetches random users from the API and updates the users state with the fetched data.

## useEffect Hook:
The useEffect hook runs when the component is mounted for the first time and when the dependencies specified in the [] dependency array change. In this case, the hook is used to call the fecthUsers function when the component is mounted, so it fetches user data from the API.

## JSX Content:
JSX is used to create the visual representation of the component inside the return statement. The users array is looped through using the map function, and for each user, a SingleUserComp component is created to display the user's information separately.

In conclusion, this code snippet represents a React component that fetches random users from an API and displays them as a list. The UserList component lists the user information using the SingleUserComp component for each individual user.
